            Hi {0},<br>
            <br>
            Regarding ticket <a href='{1}'>{3}</a>.<br>
            <br>
            A user has been created for you on deployment <a href='{2}'>{4}</a>.<br>
            <br>
            Username: <b>{3}</b>
            <br>
            Password: <b>{6}</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Connect to the Deployment using: {7}<br>
            Connect to the Workload VM using: {12}<br>
            <br>
            Credentials are valid for LMS (<a href='{5}'>{5}</a>), Workload VM, and {8}
            The LMS user has <a href='{9}'>sudo</a> rights but the ENM user is somewhat restricted.<br>
            To SSH to a VM you will need to run: <br>
            sudo ssh -i /root/.ssh/vm_private_key cloud-user@target-vm<br>
            <br>
            This user and its home directory <b><em>will be deleted when <a href='{1}'>{3}</a>
            moves out of its testing slot</em></b>.<br>
            <br>
            You can view this deployment on <a href='{10}'>DDP</a>.<br>
            <br>
            Regards,<br>
            {11}
