Please post the target ENM ISO that the server will be upgraded to ASAP the morning of the planned weekly upgrade.

If you have RPMs to be included in the weekly upgrade, please provide a link to green kgb+n upgrade job with the RPMs to be included in the table in this ticket's Description box.

Please check and confirm the RPMs are compatible with the Target ISO, rebased at near ISO green, for the ENM ISO weekly upgrade, which is typically a higher version than is available in kgb+n.
