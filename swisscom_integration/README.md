Please note that these scripts were designed and develped for particular Swisscom use cases and should be maintained by Swisscom in their own separate repo or however they wish. 
It is purely in the interest of backup and possible re-usability for others that I have checked them in here.

The majority of these scripts are quite specific but there is one in particular named 'generic.py' that some may find useful, this script can be used to send CM CLI commands from the terminal. Please see the script help text '<script> -h' for more.

NOTE: Username/Password and other configuration must be changed within the scripts if they are to be re-used at any stage.
